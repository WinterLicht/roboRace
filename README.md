# Robo Race

Robo Race is a game in development state. 
It is strongly inspired by [Robo Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboRally).
The current development state is playable at [Heroku](https://roborace.herokuapp.com).

### known bugs:
 * MoveTwice is buggy: The action doesn't get stopped if the robot falls into a pit. So "move -> fell into pit -> move" happens. 
 * Animation of MoveTwice is buggy if the direction is UpRight, DownRight, DownLeft, UpLeft.
